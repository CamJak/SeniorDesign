# Louisiana Tech Cyber Engineering Senior Design

Welcome to the repository for our Cyber Engineering senior design project!

## Project Overview

Our project seeks to solve cybersecurity issues at the weakest link, the average user. We recognize that for most people, setting up network devices to increase privacy and security seems like an impossibility, so our project looks to streamline and simplify that process so anyone can up their security.

The crux of our project is an all-in-one security device that will be plug-and-play and easy to use for users who are not versed in cybersecurity, but still offer customizability for hobbiests who want a device to secure their network.
